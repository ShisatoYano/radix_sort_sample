# radix_sort_sample

* Counting sort is a linear time sorting algorithm that sort in O(n+k) time when elements are in range from 1 to k.  
* It can not be used because it will take O(n^2) which is worse than comparison based sorting algorithm.  
* The idea of Radix Sort is to do digit by digit sort starting from least significant digit most most significant digit.  
* Radix sort and Quick sort uses hardware caches more effectively.  
* Also, Radix sort used counting sort as a subroutine and counting sort extra space to sort numbers.
